# Multiclipboard

Simple python program that saves the contents of your clipboard in to a json file to be accessed later. 


### TODO / Improvements to make
1. Create option to clear/remove key in the json file
2. Create option to reenter a key if an incorrect one is entered. As of right now the application quits/finishes if a unrecognized key is entered under "load" function
3. Need to implement some string formatting so that upper/lowercase letters don't cause issues (ex. Save, SAVE, or SaVe should lead to the same output)
4. Format the the way that the "list" function displays the data. Right now it is not the easiest to read and can be formatted for easier reading.
